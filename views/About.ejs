                    environment, close student-faculty interaction and linkages with industry and other teaching
                    academic institutions. Monitoring of students by senior managers and professionals from technical
                    world, summer internship projects are the significant measures to abreast students with the latest
                    development and requirements of professional, technological and corporate world.
